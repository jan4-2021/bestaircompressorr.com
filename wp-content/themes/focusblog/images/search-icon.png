<h3><span id="What_Is_an_Air_Compressor_and_How_It_Works">What Is an Air Compressor? and How It Works?</span></h3>
<p>Air compressors are such kind of device that converts the power (which is used by electric motors, gasoline or diesel engine etc.) into potential energy stored in pressurized air. It has a several method too. In this method, an air compressor forces more &amp; more air into a storage tank, then increasing the pressure. When the tank pressure reaches the upper limit, air compressor shuts off.<br/>
The storage tank holds the compressed air until called into use. The compressed air used for different types of work. And when the pressure reaches the lower limit, it turns on again and re-pressurizes the tank again.</p>
<h3><span id="Different_Types_of_Air_Compressors">Different Types of Air Compressors.</span></h3>
<p>We have made a list of types of air compressors. You will find all the classification of air compressors. Here you can see the list <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><a style="color: #ff0000;" rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170930161543/http://aircompressorspick.com/different-types-of-air-compressors/">Different Types of Air Compressors</a></strong></span></p>
<h3><span id="What_Are_the_Most_Important_Things_to_Notice_for_Selecting_Best_Air_Compressor">What Are the Most Important Things to Notice for Selecting Best Air Compressor?</span></h3>
<p>The essential matters that you must need to know are the size, power and CFM. When you have more air, that means you can do more work without wasting time. Because you should not need to wait for filling up the tank. If you want to use the compressor for big projects, you should really choose a large size compressor (which expressed in gallons). Usually, tank sizes range from 1 gallon- about 80 gallons. It is a fact that, if you buy a big size compressor you have to pay a big amount of money too. And a big size air compressor needs also a big space in your home or where you want to use. Another thing is portability. It will really tough to move it to another place.</p>
<p>Another important thing you should consider is that &#8216;Power&#8217;. Usually, the power is expressed in Horsepower(HP). But if you don&#8217;t know much more about it, don&#8217;t worry. Just mind it, standard AC cord is only rated for 15 Amperes currents that work about 1,800 watts. For this, the compressor will have less than 2HP, which hooked up to the standard power outlet.</p>
<p>And CFM, that means Cubic Feet per Minute. It is a rating that also expressed the power. In fact, there are several CFM rating for every compressor. The CFM means the intake ports inhale 1 cubic foot for the air at atmospheric pressure (0 psig).</p>
<h3><span id="Specifications_of_Different_Compressors">Specifications of Different Compressors:</span></h3>
<p>Though we have included all the Specification and Features, you need to notice on Role Cage, Thermal Overload Protection, Pressure Switch, Air Filters, Drain Valve and Portability.<br/>
All these things are for compressors protection and better work. So you can&#8217;t ignore these. You can see all these in the product reviews we have included bellow.</p>

<h4><span id="How_Does_It_Work">How Does It Work?</span></h4>
<p>This compressor is really awesome because of easy starting. The main parts of this compressor are the gasoline engine, pump, tank &amp; unloader. The gasoline engines basically power the pump. And the pump compresses the air. Then discharge it into the tank. The air enters air intake valves and the cylinder through the filter at atmospheric pressure, as the piston in the pump cylinder moves down-word. And when the piston moves up-word it compresses the air. Then discharge it into the tank with a check valve.<br/>
The tanks usually store the compressed air. There is a check valve in the tank which prevent the air (compressed). So that it can&#8217;t flow back to the pump.<br/>
When the pressure of air reached to the limitation, the unloader relieves the air pressure in the pump. Then transfer tube &amp; switch the engine to idle. So, the air (compressed) is used. Also the pressure level in the tank drops to a predetermined level. Then the unloader does switch the engine back for driving. And the compressor does resume pumping air.</p>
